# Velha/21 Server

A server for the games tic-tac-toe and blackjack in Node.js.

The blackjack variant follows the rules in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyoh-Ku9TCI), but assuming all
players placed the same bet. Those who leave the table with more than they
started are considered winners, and the others losers.
